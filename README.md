# DCZT developer

I'm David, a software developer. My main skills are Unity 3D, Web development, Swift and the Flutter framework. I utilize them mainly in mobile development under my alias: DCZT. You can check out my website here: [DCZT'S aka my website](https://www.dczt.dev)

## My main projects include:

- Frequency Generator
- Speaker Cleaner
- Antistress games - relaxation toys
- 1 2 3 4 Player Mini Games
- LED Scroller
- Decision Roulette
- AI Calorie Counter
- Yes or No - Decision Maker
- PDF Reader (stopped development)
- Reaction time test (stopped development)

++ More than 40 other failed projects/games/apps whatever you want to call it. Success is not about doing it right the first time but showing up every day and learning from mistakes. (I don't publish my failed projects as I feel I should move on :) )
